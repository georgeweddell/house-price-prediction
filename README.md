Using regression models to predict London house prices

House Price Prediction:
A regression-based machine learning project to predict housing prices across London boroughs using multivariate linear models.

Overview:
This project explores how various factors (e.g. year, area, average income) influence house prices in London. The goal is to build a model that can estimate house prices based on input features and demonstrate how data science techniques can support decision-making in real estate.
